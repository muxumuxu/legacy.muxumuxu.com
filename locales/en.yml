      We help established companies move like startups by working as an external product team on their greatest challenges. Together we create new products and services from scratch, improve existing products, or launch a completely new area of business.

    intro:
      title: Ventures
      description: |
        We build and launch our own ventures, but we also work with founders and compagnies to transform good ideas into great products and services. We form partnerships and contribute hands-on with design, development and whatever is needed to find a product/market fit. We are not a VC firm or an incubator, but an active partner for startups who need fuel to get their product build or get to the next level. Occasionally we also do pre-seed or seed cash investments in selected startups.
    what:
      one:
        number: '01'
        title: Our own ventures
        description: We usually form new companies based on our own ideas and products, doing everything from design to funding ourselves. We invent, design and build the product before hiring a new team to bring the product out into the world.
      two:
        number: '02'
        title: Partnerships
        description: Sometimes we form equity or royalty-based partnerships with big companies or small startups. Together we create new products and services, improve existing products, or launch a completely new area of business.
