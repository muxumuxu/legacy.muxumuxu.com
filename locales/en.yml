      title: Ventures
      description: |
        We build and launch our own ventures, but we also work with founders and compagnies to transform good ideas into great products and services. We form partnerships and contribute hands-on with design, development and whatever is needed to find a product/market fit. We are not a VC firm or an incubator, but an active partner for startups who need fuel to get their product build or get to the next level. Occasionally we also do pre-seed or seed cash investments in selected startups.
    what:
      one:
        number: '01'
        title: Our own ventures
        description: |
          We usually form new companies based on our own ideas and products, doing everything from design to funding ourselves. We invent, design and build the product before hiring a new team to bring the product out into the world.
      two:
        number: '02'
        title: Partnerships
        description: |
          Sometimes we form equity or royalty-based partnerships with big companies or small startups. Together we create new products and services, improve existing products, or launch a completely new area of business.
