            We’ve led the conception of Trace’s new iOS and Android applications, in line with Apple and Android guidelines. The application comprises many territories, each of them with their own radio streams.<br><br>TRACE joined the team as partner, so that we could fully understand their business. From day one, we used interactive prototypes.
          conclusion: |
            We delivered these applications with a back-office for desktop and mobile, so that TRACE can autonomously manage, publish and edit territories and radios: anywhere and anytime.
